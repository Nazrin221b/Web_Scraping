## Azerbaijani films.

It's a simple example of web scraping using **BeautifulSoup** and **requests.** Topic for scraping is collecting information about Azerbaijani films such as release year, runtime, director, genres, writers and etc.

In *Part 1*, I collected only names as keywords to *the wikipedia url*.

*Second Part* is scraping from wikipedia page of the movie.

After scraping we need to clean collected dataset :

*Checking duplicates*

*Handling NaN values*

*Correcting data types*
